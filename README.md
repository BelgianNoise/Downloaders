Scripts that help me download movies/series

All online video platforms keep changing and raw video downloads are generally not possible anymore.
These scripts do not work anymore. There is great affortable software solutions online for this. DYOR.

## /VRT/vrtUI.py ( Currently broken because of ytdl - [issue1](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29044) - [issue2](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29534) )
* Download full season from vrt.nu
### Required installed software
* Python : https://www.python.org/downloads/
### Run
* Run `python3 ./vrtUI.py` (It might tell you that some pip packages are missing, if so, install them `python3 -m pip install <package>`)
### How to use
* Once the application has started and you see the UI, make sure you enter a valid `vrtnu playlist link`, if you don't know what that means, please contact me.

* Download videos from GoPlay
### Required installed software
