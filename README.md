Scripts that help me download movies/series

## vrtSeasonDownload.py
This script requires at least 1 parameter:
* 1: The link to the vrt.nu page
* 2: (Optional) The path you want to download the videos to. This defaults to '/mnt/h/Films' for my own convenience.

The script will ask you for your vrt.nu login creds which should be entered like this(mind the ' ):
- username: 'email@example.com'
- password: 'yourPassword'

!!! This script requires you to have youtube-dl installed (apt install youtube-dl) !!!
